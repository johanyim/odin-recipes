    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a delicious, crispy chicken made to go nicely and rice and vegetables. 
        I named it after my wife, Kitty, who stuck with me through the thick and thin, 
        including the time when we had nothing but this to eat every day. 
        She poured happiness into the smallest details of my life, even a fried chicken.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2+ Skin-on Chicken thighs</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Tools</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Stainless steel frying pan</li>
        <li>Paper towels</li>
        <li>2 Plates</li>
        <li>(Optional) Long chopsticks</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lay the chicken skin side up, season with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Pat the chicken dry using paper towels. 
            This removes the moisture on the outside of the chicken, allowing for the best cripiness.</li>
        <li>Add some oil to the pan on high heat. Poke the oil with chopsticks, 
            You can gauge the temperature of the oil by poking the oil with chopsticks.
        </li>
        <li>When the oil is shimmering and lightly smoking, turn down the heat to medium and place the chicken in the pan, skin side down.</li>
        <li>The chicken will lie flat on the pan. Try to move it as little as possible, 
            our objective is to gain a crust which is halfway between white and golden. 
        </li>
        <li>
            When this "half-golden crust" is formed on the skin side, rotate the chicken by degrees. The skin side is still facing down, touching the pan.
            Now our objective is to form a fully golden crust. 
        </li>
        <li>Once this golden crust is formed, flip the chickens over to the non-skin side. The shape of the chikcen thighs form a sort of "triangular prism" shape.
            We will cook the uncooked sides of the triangular prism. Place the chicken in such a way that the flap of the chicken with the extra touches the pan.
            With a different chicken, imitate this same pose, using this second chicken to hold this extra skin part down, always touching the pan.
            The extra skin flap of the second chicken should also make good contact with the pan.
        </li>
        <li>Fry them for half the duration of the skin side</li>
        <li>Repeat this same process with the other side of the chicken. We should be left with a chicken which is cooked on all sides.</li>
        <li>Remove the chickens from the pan and place onto a warm, clean plate. To detmerine if the chicken is cooked, 
            the best indicator is the color of the resting juices of the chicken. We want them to be clear and without blood.</li>
        <li>Resist the urge to bite into the chickens as we want to rest them for roughly half the duration of their frying time.</li>
        <li>Done!</li>
    </ol>
